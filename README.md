I was dying to learn Tailwind CSS, and needed to setup my software engineering portfolio. Thanks to a friend's advice, I ignored lengthy tutorials and just read the docs (it actually worked!).
I picked up Tailwind on the first day, thanks to all of my previous experience with CSS & SCSS, making the project a ton of fun to do. 
I limited myself to three days of work to design, build, and deploy the website.
